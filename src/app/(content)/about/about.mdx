I'm interested in web development and desktop applications, testing and cloud
technologies.

I'm a third-year student at
[TAMK University of Applied Sciences](https://www.tuni.fi/en) in Tampere,
Finland, pursuing a degree in Information Technology with a focus on Software
Engineering.

In my free time I like to [produce music](https://music.juhamikael.info), play
video games, watch movies and series.
