Mainly built with Next.js, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS with using Shadcn/ui components. The website is hosted on Vercel.
Previous version was built with Astro, TypeScript, React and Tailwind CSS but I decided to switch to Next.js for more flexibility and to clean the codebase.

UI was designed by me in Figma and then implemented in Tailwind CSS / Pure CSS.
